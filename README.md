# Lab sheet Solutions üòå‚úåüèª

Welcome to my lab sheets repository! This repository contains lab sheets that I created during my studies <b>(Intake 39)</b>.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a helpful resource for other students who are studying similar subjects. However, I want to emphasize that copying these lab sheets is not encouraged. These sheets are intended to be used as a reference and guide, and students should try to complete the exercises on their own.

Feel free to explore the different lab sheets in this repository. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to reach out to me.

## Usage

To use these lab sheets, simply download or clone this repository to your local machine. Each lab sheet is contained in a separate directory and contains instructions and exercises for a specific topic.

## Contributing

If you would like to contribute to this repository by adding your own lab sheets or improving existing ones, please feel free to create a pull request. I would be happy to review your changes and merge them if they fit with the purpose of this repository.
